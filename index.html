        <img src="./images/profile.webp" alt="Hello, my name is Jorge Sosa" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My Jorge Sosa. I was born in the Dominican Republic, but I currently live in Santa Cruz
            de la Sierra, Bolivia. I am a passionate professional and a loving father dedicated to my two-year-old son.
            <br><br>
            I am characterized by my constant pursuit of learning and updating my skills. I enjoy my work immensely and
            strive to give my best every day. In my free time, I love spending time with my son and exploring my passion
            for cooking, where I combine Dominican flavors with the Bolivian influence I have acquired in my new
            residence.
            <br><br>
            I consider myself an enthusiastic, responsible person with a great team spirit. I am always willing to take
            on new challenges and contribute positively in any environment.
